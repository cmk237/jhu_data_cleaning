The scrip run_analysis.R retrieves the data and cleans/prepares it as outlined for the project.

1. The data is downloaded using the link, and the zip file is extracted. 

2. Dataframes containing information about features, activities, and x, y, and subject data for both training and testing are created from the extracted files.

3. The dataframes for the training and testing pairs are binded by combining rows. After that is done, all the data is combined together by binding columns.

4. Next, the column names are searched through to only contain values related to the activity, subject, means, and standard deviations.

5. Activites are then descriptively named using the data from the activity dataframe.

6. The names of all of the variables were then made more descriptive and coherent.

7. The final tidy data was then made by grouping the data by subject and activity while finding the means for all.
